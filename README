Embrace Dashboard

The projects contains the backend and frontend components and docker tooling.

The project consists of three docker containers:

backend - Gunicorn serving a Django app
frontend - Nginx serbing an Ember app
db - PostgreSQL/PostGIS

To run the project with docker just run the build-and-run.sh script from the root.
The only prerequisites are node/npm, docker, docker-compose and docker-machine.

N.B. Due to limitations in building native code for containers on OSX, you need to
have ember-cli installed and build the frontend project before running docker-compose.
The build-and-run.sh script takes care of this.

Once docker has finished building, you can start the app with:

docker-compose up

The app should be visible at http://localhost:4200

N.B. There seems to be some kind of race condition with dependencies during
startup despite being configured correctly in docker-compose.yml.

Just run `docker-compose up` a few times if you see database connection errors.

To inspect and run the standalone applications:

embrace_django/

  The backend is a django application. You can run it standalone with:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver

    But you need to provide your own database (either spatialite or postgis) and
    configure it in embrace/settings.py.


embrace_ember/

  The frontend is an ember application. You can run it standalone with:

  $ npm install
  $ ember s --proxy http://localhost:8000
